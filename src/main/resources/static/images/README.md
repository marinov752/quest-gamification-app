# Background Images Directory

This directory contains the 1080x1080px background images for light and dark themes:

- **bg-light.png** - Light mode background pattern (white background with colorful geometric shapes)
- **bg-dark.png** - Dark mode background pattern (dark charcoal background with colorful geometric shapes)

## Image Configuration
- **Size**: 1080x1080 pixels
- **Format**: PNG
- **Usage**: Images are automatically tiled/repeated across the entire page

## How It Works
The CSS automatically switches between images based on the selected theme:
- **Light theme** uses: `/images/bg-light.png`
- **Dark theme** uses: `/images/bg-dark.png`

The images repeat seamlessly across the entire page background, creating a continuous pattern effect.
